## Why this app?

This app fills a very specific niche.

If you live in an apartment building that has shared washing machines and a
common drying room for everyone, then this app may be for you. If sometimes
laundry happens to mysteriously disappear from these places, then this app helps
you keep track of questions like “How many items have I washed?” and “How many
pieces did I already fetch from the dryer?”.

## Other uses

This app can be used for different purposes.

Apart from its original use-case, this app proved to be quite useful as a
grocery list. I am currently planning a new version for shopping with mostly
cosmetic changes.
